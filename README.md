# :books:Thinkder bot
## Bot will help you find new friends and gain new skills.

:book:
*The idea is simple - if you want to get help with something, think about what you can offer in return?
You don't understand mathematics, but you have a good understanding of programming?
Help another person with programming, and he will help you with your math! <br>*
**Got it?**
